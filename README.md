# Balkonkraftwerk-Wizard

You are looking at the Client code of **Balkonkraftwerk-Wizard**. A small app that is dedicated to inform and visualize users the aspects of Mini-PV-Systems. You can checkout the Backend-Code as well at [Balkonkraftwerk-Wizard-Backend](https://github.com/ikke09/Balkonkraftwerk-Wizard-Backend/).

This app is the result of a paper during my computer science degree. The paper is not yet finished. It will be published and linked when its done.

The app is build with react-native and Expo. So if you want to try it yourself, see the setup process and install the [Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/expo-go).
